# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis Project

A comprehensive data science project analyzing bike-sharing patterns to distinguish between casual riders and annual members, providing strategic insights for converting casual riders into annual memberships.

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes 12 months of Divvy bike share data from Chicago (April 2021 - March 2022) to understand usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. The analysis incorporates weather data and uses machine learning to identify key differentiators between user types.

**Key Business Question**: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze temporal patterns (daily, weekly, seasonal) of bike usage
- Identify differences in ride duration and destination preferences  
- Incorporate weather impact on riding behavior
- Build predictive models to classify rider types
- Provide data-driven recommendations for membership conversion strategies

## üîç Key Findings

### 1. **Temporal Usage Patterns**
- **Members**: Consistent weekday usage with peaks at 7-9 AM and 4-6 PM (commuter pattern)
- **Casuals**: Higher weekend usage, more leisure-oriented timing
- **Seasonality**: Casual usage highly elastic to weather (17% peak in July vs 2% in winter), while members maintain more consistent year-round usage

### 2. **Ride Duration Differences** 
- **Members**: Short, efficient trips (median ~10-12 minutes)
- **Casuals**: Longer leisure rides, more variable duration
- **Round Trips**: Casuals frequently take round trips from tourist hubs (Navy Pier, Millennium Park), while members use point-to-point commuting

### 3. **Weather Impact**
- Temperature, precipitation, and wind significantly affect casual ridership
- Members show more weather resilience, consistent with commute necessity
- Seasonal variations more pronounced for casual users

### 4. **Geographic Patterns**
- Tourist destinations and recreational areas popular with casuals
- Business districts and residential areas favored by members
- Interactive heatmap reveals distinct usage clusters

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- **Dataset**: 12 months of Divvy trip data (5.7M+ records)
- **External Data**: Weather data integrated from Open-Meteo API
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed negative/zero durations, geographic outliers, and rides >24 hours
- **Feature Engineering**: Created temporal features (hour, day, season), weather bins, and duration categories

### Machine Learning Models

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Logistic Regression** | 0.892 | 0.917 | 0.944 | 0.930 | 0.954 |
| **Random Forest** | 0.933 | 0.945 | 0.962 | 0.953 | 0.976 |
| **XGBoost** | 0.939 | 0.949 | 0.967 | 0.958 | 0.979 |

### Key Predictive Features
1. **Rush Hour Usage** - Strong predictor of membership
2. **Ride Duration** - Short trips indicate members
3. **Day of Week** - Weekday patterns favor members
4. **Weather Conditions** - Temperature and precipitation impact
5. **Start Hour** - Morning/evening commute patterns

## üìà Business Recommendations

### 1. **Targeted Marketing Campaigns**
- **Summer Focus**: Leverage casual riders' peak summer usage (June-August)
- **Weekend Promotions**: Target leisure riders with weekend membership trials
- **Weather-Based**: Dynamic pricing/promotions during favorable weather

### 2. **Infrastructure Optimization**
- **Tourist Areas**: Increase bike availability at popular casual destinations
- **Commuter Routes**: Ensure reliable service during rush hours for members
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Redistribute bikes based on seasonal patterns

### 3. **Membership Conversion Strategies**
- **Trial Memberships**: Offer short-term memberships during peak casual usage periods
- **Commuter Incentives**: Highlight time and cost savings for regular commuters
- **Weather Resilience**: Market membership benefits during weather transitions
